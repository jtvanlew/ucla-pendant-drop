Our open-source approach to measuring surface tension with the pendant drop technique

It's crude at the moment. 

The circle_brackets file is used to 'center' the droplet between with a red reticle bracket. When it's all centered up, the pendantDrop.py script can extract surface tension from the droplet geometry.

The pendantDrop_justImages.py script spits out the images used along the way to extracting edge data (just for reference or for including in presentations when you want pretty pictures).
